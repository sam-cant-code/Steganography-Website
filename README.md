  # Steganography Suite

  <p>
    A modern web application built with React that allows you to hide secret text messages within images using LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography. You can encode your own messages or decode messages from images that have been previously encoded.

## ✨ Features

* **Encode Messages**: Hide any text message within a PNG image. The message is embedded by modifying the least significant bits of the image's pixels.
* **Decode Messages**: Extract hidden messages from steganographically encoded images.
* **Random Image Fetcher**: Don't have an image? Fetch a random high-quality image from an online service to use as a cover image.
* **Custom Image Upload**: Upload your own images (PNG, JPEG) to use for encoding or decoding.
* **Image Previews**: Instantly see a preview of your original image and the newly encoded image.
* **Download Functionality**: Download the encoded image to your device to share it.
* **Responsive Design**: A clean, modern, and fully responsive user interface that works on all screen sizes, built with Tailwind CSS.
* **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages for common issues like messages being too long or failed image fetches.
